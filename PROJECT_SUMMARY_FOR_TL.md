# Task: Intermediate-Level Flutter – Clean Architecture & Advanced State Management Implementation

* Delivered a production-ready Flutter Portfolio Application implementing Clean Architecture with 3-layer separation (Presentation, Domain, Data) and advanced Provider-based state management with type-safe state classes
* Implemented core architectural patterns including Repository Pattern, Use Case Pattern, Dependency Injection, and SOLID principles with clear separation of concerns across domain, data, and presentation layers
* Built scalable state management system with structured Provider handling Loading, Success, Error, and Operation states, eliminating unnecessary widget rebuilds through granular selectors
* Integrated centralized data sources (Remote & Local) with proper async/await handling, functional error handling using Either<Failure, Data> pattern, and SharedPreferences for local caching with offline-first strategy
* Ensured production-ready structure with dependency inversion, testable architecture, meaningful documentation, extensive const optimization, and future-ready extensibility for enterprise-level applications
